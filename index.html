        <h1>Welcome to Our Telegram Group</h1>
        <p>Thank you for joining! To maintain a positive and respectful environment, we have established the following rules. Please read carefully and adhere to them.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Be Respectful</h2>
        <p>We encourage open discussions, but all members must treat each other with respect. Hate speech, personal attacks, or discrimination will not be tolerated.</p>
        
        <h2>2. No Spamming</h2>
        <p>Do not flood the chat with unnecessary messages, promotional content, or repeated posts. This includes excessive use of emojis, CAPS LOCK, and random characters.</p>
        
        <h2>3. No Offensive Content</h2>
        <p>Sharing explicit, hateful, or violent content is strictly prohibited. Keep discussions friendly and suitable for all members.</p>
        
        <h2>4. No Unapproved Links</h2>
        <p>Links to external websites, personal blogs, or affiliate programs are not allowed unless approved by an admin.</p>
        
        <h2>5. No Political or Religious Debates</h2>
        <p>We respect all viewpoints, but this is not the place for political or religious debates, as they can be divisive.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Keep Discussions Relevant</h2>
        <p>Please stick to the group's main topic. Off-topic discussions should be taken to private messages.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Follow Admin Instructions</h2>
        <p>Admins work to keep the group organized. Failure to follow admin directions may result in removal.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Reporting Issues</h2>
        <p>If you see someone violating these rules, please report it to an admin instead of engaging in arguments.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Consequences for Rule Breaking</h2>

            <li><strong>First Violation:</strong> Warning.</li>
